# Quality Assurance Engineer Assignment
Welcome to the QA Engineer Technical Assignment. We expect the work to take a few hours, and we thank
you in advance for taking that time for us!

This test consists of two parts:  a coding part as an Automation Testing Assignment an a written part as a Documentation.


## Test Automation:

For the coding part you can clone this repo and you'll have a working frontend app by running a python http server:

```
$ python -m http.server 8000
```

You now have a working frontend app that you will write some kind of automated user acceptence tests for.

Your challenge is to write some kind of automated user acceptence tests for this app and share your repo with us.

The technical solution choices regarding language and framework are up to you, however we would prefer to see something on JS, TS or PY and possibly Playwright framework, given we use these internally. Take this chance to show your knowledge not only regarding coding but also regarding integrating different features to an automation project as reporting, parallel execution, retries, screenshots and logging when failing, etc.


## Documentation:

For the written part, we would like to receive a PDF, slide presentation or preferably an MD file (readme) with your insights. We’ll evaluate how is your way of working when dealing with an automation challenge, but you can explore this opportunity beyond the scope of this simple challenge by explaining how you proceed with the analysis of this project, planning of your tasks, technical solution selection, design pattern choice, implementation, execution, etc.

You can think about this written part both as the presentation of the project to a stakeholder and as the technical documentation for the team who could join you for maintaining or extending the project with instructions about how to use it.
